This image is used to raise awareness of the dangers of microplastics. The image portrays plastic in the brain, representing the fact that microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier. I want to inform my audience that microplastics can stay in their brain and give it a negative conotation. My intended audience is generally health concious individuals as they would be even more cautious of plastics.
